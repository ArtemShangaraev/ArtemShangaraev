Hi, I’m Artem.
I’m interested in:
  - FPGA design (VHDL mostly, both Xilinx and Intel);
  - PCB development (Altium);
  - 3D modelling (Kompas 3D);
  - Disassembly and decompilation, low-level languages;
  - Artificial intelligence;
  - A lot of other stuff...
  
I’m currently learning:
  - Timing constraints for FPGA design;
  - Disassembly with IDA Pro.
